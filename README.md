# SSE

The SSE table top role-playing game is a project I have been working on for a long time. Let me try to explain what is the essence of this game by making comparison. In this game one needs all kind of dices this is an integral part of the rules. I am conscious that most role-playing games tried for simplicity to reduce the amount of dices used but it also tends to reduce the players possibilities. In this game I try to give the players some play ground in which they can elaborate strategies. I try to do so for fight scenes as well as in negotiations and navigation.

Now by trying to do so the game got more and more complicated, such that errors of players became common and the time thinking about the rules distracted from the scenario. This is why I decided to create an app to reduce both these problems. The way it is this lead to new opportunities and the game became more and more complicated, such that there are some how two versions one which one could play without app and the full version which needs the app. I would like to mention that the rules became more compicated but not what players and masters need to know once everyone has the app.


This Project is the project the mentioned app. To make things even more interesting we now started a webpage, which via gcm connects to this app. If we succed we will introduce a new way of pen and paper role playing. If not we are writing some insane amount of code for not so much
